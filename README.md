## üìÅ How do I download Flarial Client?

To download Flarial Client go to this the [#download](https://discord.com/channels/1049946152092586054/1050115297253793882) channel. After this you have a few choices:

### Launcher Installer (Recommended)
If you use this, you will get the Flarial Minimal and the Flarial Launcher. Here are the differences:
#### Flarial Launcher
- A nice beautiful launcher to help manage Flarial and the client in general.
- Discord integrations.
- Extra Minecraft Managment.

#### Flarial Minimal
- Extremely lightweight.
- Easy to use.
- No login needed.

### Standalone DLL
If you use this, you will need an injector. You can choose to use many injectors but here are some you can use:

- **[Chyves Injector](https://github.com/notchyves/ChyvesInjector/releases/download/publish/Chyjector.zip)** (extremely small, discord integration)
- **[MCBE DLL Injector](https://github.com/ambiennt/MCBE-DLL-Injector)** (forked debloated fate injector)

You will need to setup the injector with the Flarial DLL, so it knows what to inject.

## üì± Supported Devices & Versions
This client for now only supports Windows 10/11. And you need a x64 proccesser to run it. To check this go to this screen in your Settings:

- If it says "64-bit operating system, x64-based processor", you can use Flarial Client.
- If it says "32-bit operating system, x64-based processor", you need to install the 64-bit version of Windows. You will have to look up how to do this yourself.
- If it says "32-bit operating system, x86-based processor", unfortunately, you can't use Flarial Client.
- If your PC is ARM or Qualcomm based, you can't use Flarial Client either.

Supported Minecraft Version(s):
```
1.20.30
```


## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### VCRUNTIME140_1.dll not found:
This is due to a needed resource not being installed. This most likely will require admin to do.
- Go to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003
- Scroll down and download the x64: vc_redist.x64.exe
- Run the exe and install it
- It should work now!

### Launcher says "ERROR_NO_PATH"
Disable "Custom DLL" in settings.

### Launcher says "Download failed"
This means you have connection issues with flarial.net you can try to:
- Exclude the flarial website on your antivirus.
- Use Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1) or Google DNS (8.8.8.8).
- Otherwise use the Standalone DLL.

### Client says "Failed to find address of..."
This means you are not on a supported version. You will need to upgrade or downgrade to a supported version using tools like [MCLauncher](https://github.com/MCMrARM/mc-w10-version-launcher).

## üê¶ Where can I get the Flarial Logo?
We have a compressed zip file of the Flarial logo and all of its variations. By using these you are expected to respect the Flarial name and brand and not use this to spread slander or  libel against Flarial. Enjoy :D
