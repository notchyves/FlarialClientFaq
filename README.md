### How do I remove the red arrow from Minecraft?
This is not a Flarial bug though there is a fix. Download this pack [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/kqyjo9s9ld39nkn/No+Red+Arrow+by+Mhavin.mcpack/file) and apply it. This bug happens as the pack creator/porter did not update your hud_screen.json. **This is being [actively investigated](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-105882) by Mojang.**
